The first time you do this, you have to update the publish location: open the 'publish web' dialog and make certain that the target location is in your development path.7-zip is used to create a zip archive of the web application, which is also required for a full build (the installer expects it). 7-zip is expected to be at 'C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\7z'.

Whenever you add a new file to the main library, it will automatically be included in the android lib (Visual studio provides a link between the 2 projects using a visual studio plugin).

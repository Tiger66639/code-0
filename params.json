{"name":"Code-0","tagline":"Please read carefully:•Use 'BuildAll.bat' to build the entire project. Before you can do this though, there are a couple of applications required.For the android application, it is expected that the mondroid development sdk is installed. The script expects the sdk at C:\\Users\\Esus\\AppData\\Local\\Xamarin\\MonoForAndroid\\AndroidSDK\\android-sdk-windows\\tools\\'. If this can't be found, the build will fail. Note that the installation script also expects the sdk at this location.The buildAll script also starts visual studio at one point for the web-application. The purpose for this is to perform a publish (to disk), which couldn't be automated (any solution is more than welcome). The first time you do this, you have to update the publish location: open the 'publish web' dialog and make certain that the target location is in your development path.7-zip is used to create a zip archive of the web application, which is also required for a full build (the installer expects it). 7-zip is expected to be at 'C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip\\7z'. Please update the script if it's at a different location or you want to use a different zipper.Inno setup 5 is used to build the setup application. This is expected to be at 'C:\\Program Files\\Inno Setup 5'. Please update the script if you installed it somewhere else. • Use 'buildwebsite.bat' if you only want to build the website section (including the libs it depends on) without building the android app or designer. • The 'designer.sln' visual studio project is the main development project. Both the designer and all the essential libraries are included in this project. This builds the entire designer + library (including the android lib). • The 'hosts' sub-directory contains a number of • The android library is a seperat project, but most files are simply linked from the windows library, so that the source code only has to be maintained in 1 location. Whenever you add a new file to the main library, it will automatically be included in the android lib (Visual studio provides a link between the 2 projects using a visual studio plugin). Most of the headers containing the copyright notices for the source files are auto generated using the 'code header designer' (free download from internet) The file 'GenerateCopyrightHeaders.headerx' defines how to generate these copyright notices.The help file is created with the open source project 'helpmaker'.","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"UA-56450965-1","note":"Don't delete this file!

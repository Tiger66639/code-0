   <p>
      Please read carefully:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><p>Use 'BuildAll.bat' to build the entire project. Before you can do this though, there are a couple of applications required.</p>
         <p>For the android application, it is expected that the mondroid development sdk is installed. The script expects the sdk at C:\Users\Esus\AppData\Local\Xamarin\MonoForAndroid\AndroidSDK\android-sdk-windows\tools\'. 
         If this can't be found, the build will fail. Note that the installation script also expects the sdk at this location.</p>
         <p>The buildAll script also starts visual studio at one point for the web-application. The purpose for this is to perform a publish (to disk), which couldn't
         be automated (any solution is more than welcome). The first time you do this, you have to update the publish location: open the 'publish web' dialog and make 
         certain that the target location is in your development path.</p>
         <p>7-zip is used to create a zip archive of the web application, which is also required for a full build (the installer expects it). 7-zip is expected to be at
         'C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z'. Please update the script if it's at a different location or you want to use a different zipper.</p>
         <p>Inno setup 5 is used to build the setup application. This is expected to be at 'C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 5'. Please update the script if you installed it somewhere else. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         Use 'buildwebsite.bat' if you only want to build the website section (including the libs it depends on) without building the android app or designer.
      </li>
      <li>
         The 'designer.sln' visual studio project is the main development project. Both the designer and all the essential libraries are included in this project. This
         builds the entire designer + library (including the android lib).
      </li>
      <li>
         The 'hosts' sub-directory contains a number of 
      </li>
      <li>
         The android library is a seperat project, but most files are simply linked from the windows library, so that the source code only has to be maintained in 1 location.
         Whenever you add a new file to the main library, it will automatically be included in the android lib (Visual studio provides a link between the 2 projects using a 
         visual studio plugin).
      </li>
      
   </ul>

   <p>Most of the headers containing the copyright notices for the source files are auto generated using the  'code header designer' (free download from internet)
   The file 'GenerateCopyrightHeaders.headerx' defines how to generate these copyright notices.</p>
   <p>
   The help file is created with the open source project 'helpmaker'.

<p>Use 'BuildAll.bat' to build the entire project. Before you can do this though, there are a couple of applications required.</p>
         <p>For the android application, it is expected that the mondroid development sdk is installed. The script expects the sdk at C:\Users\Esus\AppData\Local\Xamarin\MonoForAndroid\AndroidSDK\android-sdk-windows\tools\'. 
         If this can't be found, the build will fail. Note that the installation script also expects the sdk at this location.</p>
         <p>The buildAll script also starts visual studio at one point for the web-application. The purpose for this is to perform a publish (to disk), which couldn't

         The 'designer.sln' visual studio project is the main development project. Both the designer and all the essential libraries are included in this project. This

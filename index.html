    Build and release instructions

      Please read carefully:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>
<p>Use 'BuildAll.bat' to build the entire project. Before you can do this though, there are a couple of applications required.</p>
         <p>For the android application, it is expected that the mondroid development sdk is installed. The script expects the sdk at C:\Users\Esus\AppData\Local\Xamarin\MonoForAndroid\AndroidSDK\android-sdk-windows\tools\'. 
         If this can't be found, the build will fail. Note that the installation script also expects the sdk at this location.</p>
         <p>The buildAll script also starts visual studio at one point for the web-application. The purpose for this is to perform a publish (to disk), which couldn't
         be automated (any solution is more than welcome). The first time you do this, you have to update the publish location: open the 'publish web' dialog and make 
         certain that the target location is in your development path.</p>
         <p>7-zip is used to create a zip archive of the web application, which is also required for a full build (the installer expects it). 7-zip is expected to be at
         'C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z'. Please update the script if it's at a different location or you want to use a different zipper.</p>

      <li>
         The 'designer.sln' visual studio project is the main development project. Both the designer and all the essential libraries are included in this project. This
         builds the entire designer + library (including the android lib).

      <li>
         The android library is a seperat project, but most files are simply linked from the windows library, so that the source code only has to be maintained in 1 location.
         Whenever you add a new file to the main library, it will automatically be included in the android lib (Visual studio provides a link between the 2 projects using a 
         visual studio plugin).
